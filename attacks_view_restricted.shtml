<H3>Access to Attack Files is restricted.
</H3>

<P>Part of the reason behind LongTail's attack analysis is to
try and find coordination between different IP Addresses.  The 
only non-intrusive way is to compare attack patterns between 
websites.
<P>By publishing attack patterns, I run the risk of contaminating
my data set.  If more than one site starts using the same attack
pattern, is it because they are controlled by the same person,
sharing information betweend attackers, OR, did they download the
attack pattern from LongTail and start using the copied attack
pattern.
<P>The only way to prevent that from happening is to restrict 
access to attack patterns larger than 128 characters.  This is 
a fine line between giving enough access, and too much access,
and I think people should at least be able to see the smaller
attack patterns.
<P>Please contact me if you are a verifiable researcher and I can
share historical data with you after the 90 day window of Marist 
College only access has passed.
