<P>LongTail is a program that analyzes ssh brute force attacks
and statistically quantifies them based on IP addresses used,
Accounts, passwords, AND account/password pairs, and (what 
nobody else is doing at the moment) analyzing attack patterns
for commonality and number of times used.

<P>LongTail was written by Eric Wedaa and has been released under GPL V2

<P>Raw input data from longtail.it.marist.edu  will be made available 90 days after it was
collected OR 90 days after the official "opening" of LongTail.it.marist.edu
in order to allow Marist time to analyze the data and report on 
the data first.

<P>Data  from longtail.it.marist.edu may be used by third parties as long as attribution is
made to Eric Wedaa, LongTail Log Analysis, and Marist College.

<P>Access to Attack Files is restricted.

<P>Part of the reason behind LongTail's attack analysis is to
try and find coordination between different IP Addresses.  The 
only non-intrusive way is to compare attack patterns between 
websites.
<P>By publishing attack patterns, I run the risk of contaminating
my data set.  If more than one site starts using the same attack
pattern, is it because they are controlled by the same person,
sharing information betweend attackers, OR, did they download the
attack pattern from LongTail and start using the copied attack
pattern.
<P>The only way to prevent that from happening is to restrict 
access to attack patterns.
<P>Please contact me if you are a verifiable researcher and I can
share historical data with you after the 90 day window of Marist 
College only access has passed.
