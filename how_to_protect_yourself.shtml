<H3>How Can You Protect Yourself?</H3>
<P><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">
The only winning move is not to play.</a>


<P>So...  What can you do to protect yourself?  There is no one
single thing you can do other than turning off ssh to protect 
yourself, so it's all about "<A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_in_depth_%28computing%29">Defense in Depth</A>.  This is a layering 
approach of preventitive measures so that if one layer fails, then the 
next layer stops them.

<LI>Don't play the game!  If you don't have to ssh into a server, 
(which probably means a Linux server running at home), then
disable ssh.  If you're not running ssh, then they can't attack you.
<LI>If you <B>have</B> to run ssh, and there are only a few
people logging into it, then run ssh on a different port.  This 
obviously won't work if you have more than 2 or 3 people logging 
into the box as somebody will forget what port to use and will
raise a ruckus.  As can be seen at <A href="http://longtail.it.marist.edu/honey-2222/index.shtml">Port 2222 ssh attack analysis</A>, the bad 
guys rarely attack ports other than port 22.
<LI><B>No matter what,</B> don't allow root to ssh into your server.  
Make sure your 
/etc/ssh/sshd_config has "PermitRootLogin no" set. </LI>
<LI>ssh is "tcpwrappers" aware.  That means you can use the
files /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny to tell ssh to accept
only inbound ssh connections from certain hosts, and then deny
all other inbound connections.
<LI>If you can't use hosts.allow and hosts.deny, then you can
install software on your server to actively block inbound ssh
attempts that appear to be attacks.  Two of the most popular
are <A href="http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/">DenyHosts</a> and <A href="http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Fail2Ban</A>.
<LI>If you have "enough" hosts, then you should probably purchase
an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_prevention_system">Intrusion prevention systems</a>.
<LI>Don't use stupid passwords.  Passwords like "password", 
"admin", and "123456" and their assorted variations are the 
top passwords that ssh brute force attacks try.</LI>
<LI>Longer passwords are better than shorter passwords.  As can
be seen on <a href="http://longtail.it.marist.edu/honey/password_analysis_todays_passwords.shtml">Password Analysis of Today's Passwords</A>, 91 percent
of the passwords they tried were 12 characters or less.</LI>
<LI>Don't keep the default passwords for any software you install.
Looking at Google for the passwords tried shows that many of them
are default passwords for one piece of software or another.</LI>
<LI>Don't keep the default passwords for any hardware (including 
routers).  They keep trying "admin" accounts with the password
"admin" which was a default for older home routers.
